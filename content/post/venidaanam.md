Venidaanam is a vedic ritual performed usually as a part of the Kasi yatra. As a part of this ritual, women offer a part of their hair to the river praying for the long life of their husbands. The husband plaits the wifeâ€™s hair, decorates it with flowers and cuts off the tip of the plait and offers it to the river. It is an interesting fact that while hair normally floats on water, at the Sangam; it immediately sinks to the river bed. Though almost all married women offer their hair here, there is not a single strand found floating on the river.)
